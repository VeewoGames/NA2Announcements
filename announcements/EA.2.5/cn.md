# Beta Branch Update

## Weapon Affix System

### Affixes

Weapons now feature a brand-new affix system. Each weapon has fixed affixes and randomly generated dynamic affixes. Dynamic affixes include direct damage bonuses, resource bonuses, and unique mechanics. Higher weapon levels increase the chance and potency of dynamic affixes.

### Rarity

Weapons and affixes now have rarity tiers: Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. Higher rarity affixes offer more powerful effects, giving your weapon a unique growth path and goals to pursue in each run.

### Flexible Upgrading

Weapon upgrade choices have been expanded! In addition to the existing treasure options, you can now choose to **Temper** your weapon, adding a new affix for more flexible and varied growth paths.

## Patch System Optimization

Based on player feedback, we noticed that many felt frustrated by having to fail before being able to use patches. To address this, we've changed the system to a charge-based mechanic. Now, defeating any Boss will charge the patch by 1 energy. Once it reaches 3 charges, the patch can be activated. However, please note that you cannot gain charges in the same run where a patch is active. Additionally, we've added an "Infinite Energy" option in the settings for players with specific needs. Please use it with caution, as it will significantly reduce the game's difficulty and overall enjoyment.

**Note:** The fixed descriptions on weapons are currently outdated and no longer accurate. A weapon's growth path is now entirely determined by its affixes. The current affix power might be a bit too strong. We need more time to fine-tune the balance. In the meantime, feel free to enjoy the overpowered fun!

**If you encounter any issues in the Beta branch, whether related to gameplay or bugs, please feel free to join our Discord and provide feedback. Your experiences and thoughts are crucial for us to improve the game!**

### How to Switch to the Beta Branch
