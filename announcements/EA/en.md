# Agents, long time no see

As a sequel, we aim to deliver a blend of familiarity and novelty in Neon Abyss 2 for our Agents. While retaining the core gameplay, we’ve fully upgraded the audiovisual experience: Agents can now enjoy more intricate pixel art and a richer, more dynamic BGM!

Additionally, Neon Abyss 2 introduces a host of new systems and content:

* **Online Co-op Mode** for chaotic surprises
* **Faith System** with customizable build paths
* **Soul Weapon System** for imaginative combat
* **Fate System** adding unpredictable twists
* A flood of meme-packed **Hatchmon** collectibles and new items...and more! Dive deep to uncover it all.
After Early Access launch, we’ll continue polishing the experience and adding fresh content. Check the homepage roadmap anytime for development updates.

Encounter bugs, optimizations, or other issues? Report them via the in-game **Report an Issue** option (in the menu).

Thank you for your unwavering support, Agents! We hope you’ll embrace this passion-driven sequel where our dreams take shape.

**Let’s ignite the Abyss once again!**
