What is up, Agents! We’re back with Glimmer Heist, our latest update along the Neon Abyss 2 Early Access roadmap! In addition, we’ve got a new roadmap, as well - making sure that all of the upcoming changes to the Abyss are working on the things which are important to our Agents!

# Roadmap Update

Adjustment Notes: We've temporarily removed the planned Curse system and replaced it with the Weapon Affix system to further enrich gameplay depth. **Aphrodite** has been moved before the **Erinyes**, while the Curse system remains under evaluation.

# Update Highlights

We’ve got a few new elements hitting the Abyss today so read on below to find out more about

* Our brand-new Agent! Cassie
* Stats System Overhaul: More ways you can see (and affect) your stats!
* Training Center in the Bar: A new way to find a new favourite weapon!
* A returning Titan Boss: Prometheus
* Regular Boss: Goddess Of Gallery
* New NPC Stories in the bar
* 31 new items
* Visual improvements for UI and some special rooms
# **Welcome to the Glimmer Heist, Cassie!**

First up in the glimmering new Abyss is our new Agent - Cassie. Cassie is a rogue-ish little rebel with an eye for all things gold - and a penchant for robbing from the rich to give to the poor (as long as we class Cassie as “the poor”, right?).

Cassie’s standard weapon is the ranged Glint gun - which fires a lucky bullet every four shots. The number of lucky bullets scales with the keys you have, and Cassie has a way to  help you out there, as well.

To help you get more keys, you can save them up and use Cassie’s special ability - a Carousel Music Box - to unlock doors and chests in place of keys! Doing so does run a little risk, as if you get your timing wrong you might take some damage, but it also comes with its own reward as well.

# **A Gods Shooting Gallery!**

### Prometheus

Titan Boss (Free DLC)

We’re also bringing back a Titan of the first Abyss, with Prometheus making his way towards Neon Abyss 2 at an alarming rate (like, “he’s in there now and he’s gonna kick your butt” type alarming).

While we’re pretty sure Prometheus is going to give you enough of a challenge, we’re also throwing a new regular God into the mix - Lisa the God of Galleries! She’ll give you some gallery-security to keep you on your toes (and it’s tighter than the Louvre), so just, stay out of the red, right?

# New Stat Systems

### Stats Reforging

We’ve now split stats into six exciting new categories, separating out Damage Bonus, Attack Speed, Projectile Range, Projectile Size, Critical Chance and Luck! Now I know what you’re asking, what’s the point of seeing these, what you want to do is change them, right?

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VeewoGames/NA2Announcements/master/announcements/EA.1.29/20260129_160637_4125224165545715445.png)

Well, good news! Our new Artefact Extraction system lets you do just that, with direct impact on one or some of these stats! Extracting destroys artefacts, and instead adds bonuses to each of the six primary stats, and you can check on each of these in the pause menu!

### Smiley Counter Rework

The basic Smiley Counter now only offers Stat Gems as rewards, with a chance to win the Grand Prize!

# **The All-New Training Room!**

Once you get stuck in your ways, it can be really hard to find a new favourite weapon in the Abyss (how do you beat a ball-bouncing tennis racket?). To help you our a little, we’ve added a whole new area of the Bar, accessible through the door downstairs, to let you test drive new weapons.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VeewoGames/NA2Announcements/master/announcements/EA.1.29/20260129_160653_522306097025510576.png)

In the Training Room Agents can select any unlocked weapon and take it into our holo-room (I’ve been told that I am legally not allowed to call it a HoloDeck… thanks Gene Roddenberry). Here you can check out the damage the new weapon can do against static, moving or multiple targets, all in a safe and controlled area where even you can’t muck it up.

# Bar Stories

Some of the NPCs in the Bar have come to life, each offering a unique story for you to unravel.

### HUD Visual Update

To align with the overall modern and sci-fi aesthetic of Neon Abyss 2, we have redesigned and standardized the appearance of Hearts and Shields to more intuitively display HP information.

**If you prefer the old style, you can switch back to the classic heart and shield icons in the Gameplay Options.**
