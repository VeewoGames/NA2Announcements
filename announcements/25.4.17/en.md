# Multiplayer Playtest

Cybermyth Combatants,

Welcome to the Multiplayer Playtest. **Please note that the multiplayer feature is still in the technical testing phase.** You may encounter various instabilities, such as: game lag or latency / unexpected disconnections / interaction anomalies / other sporadic errors, etc. Neon Abyss 2 uses a P2P (peer-to-peer) connection method, meaning players connect directly to each other. 

Please note that the current quick match and online list features are not yet working properly; you need a room code to play with others.

**Online Co-op**

To ensure a smooth gaming experience, the current version only supports 2-player co-op. We will decide when to enable 3 or 4-player mode based on test feedback. The game uses a P2P (peer-to-peer) connection method, meaning players connect directly to each other, with the host acting as the server.

**New Agent:** Elisa

**New Faith: **AGAPEISM

We will continue optimizing the gaming experience during this period. If you encounter any issues, please submit them using the F3 key in the game. Every report you provide will help us improve the game.

Thank you for your understanding and support. Let's work together to create a better Neon Abyss!
