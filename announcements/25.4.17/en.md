# Multiplayer Technical Test is now open!

Cybermyth Combatants,

Welcome to the Multiplayer Technical Test. Please note that the multiplayer feature is still in the technical testing phase. You may encounter various instabilities, such as: game lag or latency / unexpected disconnections / interaction anomalies / other sporadic errors, etc. Neon Abyss 2 uses a P2P (peer-to-peer) connection method, meaning players connect directly to each other. 

For now, the test only supports 2-player multiplayer. We will decide when to open 3-4 player co-op based on the testing.

We will continue optimizing the gaming experience during this period. If you encounter any issues, please submit them using the F3 key in the game. Every report you provide will help us improve the game.

New additions in this test: a new agent (Elisa) and a new faith.

Thank you for your understanding and support. Let's work together to create a better multiplayer experience!
