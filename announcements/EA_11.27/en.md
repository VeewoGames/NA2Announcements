# New Mechanics

## Co-op Item Sharing

**To enhance the multiplayer experience, we've optimized loot and item distribution mechanics.**

All drops are automatically assigned to players to prevent malicious sniping. Meanwhile, players can voluntarily share their loot with teammates, achieving a balance between fair distribution and free exchange.

**Specific rules:**

* Upon generation, drops can only be collected by their original owner
* Common drops (Coins, Bombs, Keys, etc.) become collectable after a set duration
* Special drops like Artifacts remain exclusive until manually shared

## Visual Clutter Optimization

To address potential visual chaos during combat, we've overhauled all attack effects and follower visuals. Players can now freely adjust their transparency in settings, toggling between "spectacular effects" and "clean visuals" as preferred. Find these options under **Settings > Graphics**.
