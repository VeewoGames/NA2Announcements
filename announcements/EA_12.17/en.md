**Festive Greetings, Agents! In time for the holiday break, today we’ve deployed an update that touches a few areas of the Abyss - with optimisations, bug fixes and some festive cheer for the bar!**

That’s right! Just like halloween, we’ve been taking some time to hang decorations, and make sure that the Abyss has that little yuletide edge. BUT that’s not all, and we’ve also been continuing to get fixes and tweaks ready for you.

We hope you have a great break over the festive period, and don’t worry. We’ll still be hard at work to get ready for some great new content hitting the Abyss in the new year!

So - apart from the bar decorations - here’s what’s changed in the Abyss in today’s patch:

* N.b. This is an update which can cause mid-run saves to get a little twisted - please try to complete current runs before updating to reduce risk of sadness.
### **Bug Fixes:**

* We’ve fixed an issue where weapon badge levels were lost when continuing game saves
* We’re fixed issues where maximum health bars would display incorrectly after using health-reducing abilities
* We’ve fixed room doors malfunctioning after defeating monsters (basically added a load of WD-40)
* We’ve fixed the Hatchmon Snippie - who would sometimes fail to snip in very specific circumstances.
### **Optimisations:**

* Major tweaks to the Hermes boss battle - significantly reducing invincibility and invisibility durations
* Tweaks for the combat experience and sound effects for the God of Talkshow
* Tweaks to the item-collection release time (we’ve REDUCED the initial restriction period to improve game flow)
