# July 25th Update Announcement

# Update Overview

We have fixed an issue that could be caused by **Sāya**'s fishing on the Default Branch.
On the Beta Branch, we have updated the **Continue Game** feature and fixed an issue from yesterday's Beta where entering the Soul Room would cause immediate teleportation out.

On the Beta Branch, you can now exit the game mid-run in **Single-Player Mode** and **Continue Game** later. Your progress will resume from the starting room of each level.
