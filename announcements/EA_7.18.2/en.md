# Patch Notes 7.18_2

Thank you to all players who have supported *Neon Abyss 2 (Early Access)*. We’ve felt your passion and enthusiasm through recent feedback, but we’ve also heard frustrations, particularly regarding bugs in recent updates.

While we conduct internal testing, our limited experience in developing online multiplayer games has led us to adopt a cautious approach to avoid introducing new issues via rushed fixes. To address this, we’ve launched a **Beta branch**. This branch will receive **daily updates** to rapidly resolve reported issues and optimize gameplay, though it may be less stable. If you prefer **faster update cycles**, you can switch to this branch.

For the **default branch**, we will only deploy urgent bug fixes immediately, while non-critical fixes will follow a **weekly update schedule** to ensure a more stable experience.

### How to Switch to the Beta Branch

Steam Library → Neon Abyss 2 → Right-click → Properties → Betas → Select "Beta" (no password required).

**Note:** Players on different branches cannot connect for multiplayer due to version mismatches.

### Default Branch Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the **"Chidori Kunai"** item caused weapons to stop firing.
* Resolved a bug that caused characters to freeze in **online co-op mode**.
* Temporary connectivity tweaks, we hope they reduce failed connections, as the potential culprit has being identified, but we need a few days to fix and test.
### Beta Branch Updates

* Fixed **controller focus loss** when browsing room lists.
* Optimized performance during the **Titan Boss fight** to reduce stuttering and frame rate drops.
* Added support for **mouse side button (forward/backward keys) mapping**, customizable in settings.
* Adjusted UI elements (buttons, panels, tooltips) to fix visual misalignment, color schemes, and spacing.
We sincerely apologizes to players who have encountered subpar experiences. We are fully committed to resolving all current bugs and gameplay issues as our top priority. Your feedback is invaluable—please keep sharing it with us!
