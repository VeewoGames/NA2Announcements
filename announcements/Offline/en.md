# TESTING PERMISSIONS REQUIRED

There will be a limit for access to the multiplayer playtest, but we'll be rolling out access to more people, just to ensure that we can stress test and load balance servers instead of overwhelming the new Abyss with a huge influx of players.

The team will be allocating access to the multiplayer test slowly but regularly, so if you've applied but don't get access straight away, this is pretty normal. We'll be doing everything we can to get as many of you into the Abyss 2.0 as we can over the course of the playtest, so folks should keep an eye on your e-mail and Discord for more information.
