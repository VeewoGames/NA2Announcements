# **First Playtest Begins**

Dear Pioneer Agent:

Congratulations on being selected as the vanguard of the Blackdog Squadâ€”the key to the Abyss Gateway 2.0 is now in your hands!

This test will be the first time the core combat module is opened to agents, and we look forward to perfecting the ultimate form of the Neon World together with you. Since the game is still in development, many contents and mechanics may be subject to changes and adjustments. Of course, you may also encounter some bugs, but please don't be upset.

### Test Content Includes

* 24 Soulforged Weapons, each with a unique combat style
* 4 Normal Bosses, 1 Manager
* Over 400 Artifacts
* Over 70 Magic Artifacts
* Over 70 Relics
* 5 Levels
### **Test Notes**

* This test will last for 7 days and will close on March 27.
* Peripheral systems will not be open during this test, and no data will be retained.
* Only single-player mode is available in this test; multiplayer functionality is temporarily unavailable.
* When encountering a bug, press **[F3]** to submit it and help us optimize the game.
* Any feedback on your experience (including but not limited to gameplay suggestions/control experience/art evaluation) can be submitted via **[F4]**.
Every feedback and suggestion you submit will become the cornerstone of the official version.

Now, please grip your weapon, adjust the resonance frequency of your cybernetic body, and let the neon of the abyss flicker anew because of you.
